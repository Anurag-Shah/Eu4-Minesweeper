 minesweeper.5.d: "Click on a tile to open the underlying province view; use this to advance. The administrative development button clears a tile, while the military development button flags the tile. The diplomatic development button will clear everything adjacent to a cleared tile, provided it has the right number of flags around it.\n\nClearing a tile will show you the number of bombs next to it, or will end the game if it is a bomb tile. Flagging a tile is a useful way to mark where all the bombs are. You must flag every bomb and clear every other tile to win the game!\n\nNote: you may find it useful to use the development macrobuilder to play the game more efficiently."

 minesweeper.6a: "Try Again"
 minesweeper.6b: "Understood"
 minesweeper.7.t: "Victory!"
 minesweeper.7.d: "You have successfully cleared every tile and flagged the bombs. Congrats!"
 minesweeper.7a: "Play a New Game"
 minesweeper.7b: "Yay!"
 minesweeper.8.t: "Tutorial"
 minesweeper.8.d: "Welcome to Minesweeper in EU4!\n\nPlaying this game is simple. First, make sure you are playing as the Minesweeper country. If you are not, click the \"Switch to Minesweeper Country\" decision. Next, you will want to initialize your game. You can do this by clicking the \"Play Minesweeper\" decision. This will pop up an event asking you how many bombs you want in the game, keep in mind it is a 10x10 grid with 100 tiles; select an option or customize your choice, and you can get started.\n\nThe game grid is located in the middle of the atlantic ocean. When a game has begun, you will see the tiles populate on the grid.\n\nIn order to clear or flag tiles, click on the tile to open the province view of the underlying province. Click the administrative development button to clear the tile, or the military development button to flag the tile. The diplomatic development button will clear everything adjacent to a cleared tile, provided it has the right number of flags around it. Clearing a tile will show you the number of bombs next to it, or will end the game if it is a bomb tile. Flagging a tile is a useful way to mark where all the bombs are. The number on the tile represents the number of bombs that are adjacent to it (up to a maximum of 8). You must flag every bomb and clear every other tile to win the game!\n\nThere is a decision in the window where you can view how many bombs there are in total, and how many flags you have placed. If you accidentally clear a bomb, don't worry. The board will show the solution, and you can restart to a new game whenever you want!\n\nThe game looks prettiest when played in April or May, but is functionally the same in every month!\n\nHave fun playing, and good luck!"
 minesweeper.8a: "I Want to Play!"
 minesweeper.8b: "Understood."

 msw_idea_1: "Why are you here?"
 msw_idea_1_desc: "Seriously, what led you to read the Minesweeper Tag ideas?"
 msw_idea_2: "This has nothing to do with the game."
 msw_idea_2_desc: "I don't think you would play this mod as a part of a regular EU4 game anyways. It's too laggy, and not to mention the giant grid in the atlantic."
 msw_idea_3: "These ideas are useless."
 msw_idea_3_desc: "This tag has a giant wasteland grid surrounding it. You cannot increase development as this tag. In fact, you literally cannot have enough monarch power to take technology or ideas, and it would be a stretch to get enough money and manpower to construct units."
 msw_idea_4: "This tag has one purpose."
 msw_idea_4_desc: "You play this country to play a game of minesweeper. I don't understand why you want to do anything else as it."
 msw_idea_5: "You shouldn't be looking at this."
 msw_idea_5_desc: "Seriously, you must have better things to do. Go talk to your mom/dad/guardian/significant other/children/literally anyone. Touch some grass."
 msw_idea_6: "How are you still here?"
 msw_idea_6_desc: "Sure, the mod is fun, and I, the dev, have put a lot of effort into it to make it fun. But, it's a video game at the end of the day, and your real life, and its responsibilities, take priority. Please, go tend to your basic needs, or accomplish something productive with your time. The fact that you downloaded and tried this mod out in the first place is enough for me."
 msw_idea_7: "Have a good day."
 msw_idea_7_desc: "Shoot me a message on discord or something if you actually bothered to look at ideas in game and found this."
